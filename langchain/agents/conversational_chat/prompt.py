Assistant has access to the following tools:"""
FORMAT_INSTRUCTIONS = """When responding, you have two choices.

First, you can just respond normally. When you do this, anything you say will be returned to the user.

Second, you can use one of the above tools to get an answer, which you can then use as information later on.
The way you use the tools is by specifying  a valid json blob.
Specifically, this json should have a `action` key (with the name of the tool to use) and a `action_input` key (with the input to the tool going here).

The only values that should be in the "action" field are: {tool_names}

The $JSON_BLOB should only contain a SINGLE action, do NOT return a list of multiple actions. Here is an example of a valid $JSON_BLOB:

```
{{{{
  "action": $TOOL_NAME,
  "action_input": $INPUT
}}}}
```"""
